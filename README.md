Hello all, Iâ€™m @UAlhuwaymel, a junior physics undergraduate student interested in machine learning and its applications. I'm trying to balance between learning the mathematics that governs machine learning, linking physics concepts to cutting-edge research, and applying my understanding to form machine learning models (mainly using Python).

I am willing to collaborate with people interested in computational work, whether it's based on physics, machine learning, or any other fun and difficult problem ;).

You can also find me on LinkedIn. Here is my profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/umar-alhuwaymel/
